In June 2004, Dave from AddedBytes.com posted an article titled Email Address Validation, which included a function for validating email addresses according to RFC 2822 and related documents. It tested only for technical validity, nothing more.

The post proved to be reasonably popular, generating a lot of comments and additions from other PHP developers. Unfortunately, he was not too hot at keeping up, and many improvments took too long to make it to the posted version of the function.

The original version was posted on by Dave on Google Code. Joel Dare created a copy of it in GitHub on January 14, 2014.
