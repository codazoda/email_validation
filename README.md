In June 2004, Dave from AddedBytes.com posted an article titled Email Address Validation, which included a function for validating email addresses according to RFC 2822 and related documents. It tested only for technical validity, nothing more.

The post proved to be reasonably popular, generating a lot of comments and additions from other PHP developers. Unfortunately, I was not too hot at keeping up, and many improvments took too long to make it to the posted version of the function.
